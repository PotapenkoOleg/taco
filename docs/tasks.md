# Taco Improvement Tasks

## Architecture and Design
[ ] 1. Implement a proper error handling strategy with custom error types instead of using anyhow::Error directly
[ ] 2. Create a clear separation between UI and business logic
[ ] 3. Implement a proper logging system instead of using println! and eprintln!
[ ] 4. Design and implement a plugin architecture for facts collectors
[ ] 5. Create a configuration system for application settings
[ ] 6. Implement a proper testing strategy with unit, integration, and end-to-end tests
[ ] 7. Add a CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment
[ ] 8. Create a proper documentation system with API docs and user guides

## Code Quality
[ ] 9. Refactor the main.rs file to reduce its size and complexity
[ ] 10. Remove code duplication between process_query and process_command functions
[ ] 11. Implement proper error handling in the Server::fmt method to avoid panics
[ ] 12. Add proper documentation comments to all public functions and types
[ ] 13. Implement missing functionality for TODOs in the codebase
[ ] 14. Add proper validation for user inputs
[ ] 15. Implement proper handling for all PostgreSQL data types

[ ] 23. Implement a batch mode for executing multiple commands in sequence
[ ] 24. Add support for variables in queries and commands

## Security
[ ] 25. Implement proper password handling (avoid storing in plain text)
[ ] 26. Add support for environment variables for sensitive information
[ ] 27. Implement proper authentication and authorization mechanisms
